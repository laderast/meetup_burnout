subtitle: "Make it Welcoming"

In our last two sections, we started thinking about making our meetup sustainable with two steps: self-care and building a strong core group. Now let's start talking about how to grow your group by making the tone welcoming.

## Grow by Word of Mouth

By establishing our core group, we started small. Now your group will grow. How does it do this? By positive word of mouth. Invite a couple people to start out with.

## Aim for Pyschological Safety


## Welcoming = Values + Code of Conduct

In order to be psychologically safe, your meetup should have a code of conduct. You don't need to write one from scratch; the R-Ladies Code of Conduct is a great place to start. Codes of conduct are extremely important, because they define what is unacceptable behavior at a meetup. That's the negative side.

But you also need to positively model the values you established as a core group in Part 2. Being conscious of these values is incredibly important, as they set the positive tone for the group. Some of the values of PDX-R are:

- Learn Together
- Beginner Friendly
- Have Fun with Data

If you're lucky, by establishing tone, you will actually define the norms for the group, which is the case for groups like R for Data Science. What once seemed artificial will become the norm for the group. 

## Co-working and Co-learning
