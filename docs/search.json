It can just be social. The point is to do something together: watching a video together, doing a workshop together, or troubleshooting problems together. You’ll be surprised by the knowledge in your group. Everyone knows something, and when we come together, we will always be more than the sum of our knowledge.\nIn a later part, I’m going to talk more about meetup activities that work for us, and more importantly, the importance of having meetups where it is easy for your attendees to contribute to."

They’re what drive you to organize, and you need to define your success in terms of those values.

We have a core group of people who nearly always come, and it’s wonderful to see new attendees.\nIf you do have lofty expectations, make them a long term goal and focus on one aspect at a time, such as making your meetup more welcoming, or finding someone else to help host the meetups."

There is a cure for that, and that is finding co-organizers for your meetup.\nThese co-organizers should be people you can trust and depend on, that you want to hang out with. Even if no one else came to a meetup event, you will still get to hang out with them and it won’t feel like wasted effort. You should have shared values.\nIt’s better to identify people and approach them directly rather than putting out a call for organizers. Perhaps there was a member of previous meetups that was especially helpful to others.\nThe key piece of advice that I’ve gotten from many organizers is to: start small with your core group, rather than starting with large events from the get-go. Having a strong core group will naturally grow through word of mouth."

There are specific needs for your meetup:\n\nMeetup Space\nDedicated online discussion forums (such as Slack/Microsoft Teams/Discord)\nPrep time for talks/activities\n\nSponsors can help with these needs. I’ve heard time and again from internal meetup attendees that they like the meetup, but they’re often too busy with other work to attend regularly. This is often a sign of an organizational culture that prizes busy-ness (not business) over personal development. Sponsors can help with this by opening up work schedules for personal development."

Organizing meetups is important emotional labor, as you are building ties across groups in your organization. Negotiating for protected time when you can do this work is a very good start. Making sure that the meetup is included as criteria for yearly reviews is also important. If you are doing it to benefit your organization, you should be recognized for it.\nMeetups often result in collaboration across groups, and improved morale in an organization. Organizations often brag that they are a learning organization. Hold their feet to the fire so that they support this important venue for learning, collaboration, and development. Some of this may have to do with managing up: understanding the motivations of your supervisors and showing the benefits of the meetup in language that matters to them. At the very least, show alignment of your group with their overall strategy - show how the meetup will contribute to their goals.\nGathering testimonies from meetup attendees is another important type of evidence of impact. Approaching people who are getting a lot out of your meetup and asking for a couple sentences about the benefits they’ve enjoyed from the meetup can be very useful, especially in a final report used in a performance review."

I believe that the test of any good group is whether you can leave it and it can continue on.\nIn the final part, we’ll talk about how to make your meetup welcoming to new attendees. Sustaining a meetup has to do a lot with making it appealing to people who will contribute, and making it easy for those people to contribute.

    "text": "Welcoming = Values + Code of Conduct\nIn order to be psychologically safe, your meetup should have a code of conduct. You don’t need to write one from scratch; the R-Ladies Code of Conduct is a great place to start. Codes of conduct are extremely important, because they define what is unacceptable behavior at a meetup. That’s the negative side.\nBut you also need to positively model the values you established as a core group in Part 2. Being conscious of these values is incredibly important, as they set the positive tone for the group. Some of the values of PDX-R are:\n\nLearn Together\nBeginner Friendly\nHave Fun with Data\n\nIf you’re lucky, by establishing tone, you will actually define the norms for the group, which is the case for groups like R for Data Science. What once seemed artificial will become the norm for the group."
