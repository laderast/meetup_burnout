I think a lot of us are stuck in the seminar mindset: every event should be a didactic talk where some expert is teaching us something.\nThese expectations are what drive us to meetup burnout.\nA meetup event doesn’t need to be this. It can just be social. The point is to do something together: watching a video together, doing a workshop together, or troubleshooting problems together. You’ll be surprised by the knowledge in your group. Everyone knows something, and when we come together, we will always be more than the sum of our knowledge.\nIn a later part, I’m going to talk more about meetup activities that work for us, and more importantly, the importance of having meetups where it is easy for your attendees to contribute to."

They’re what drive you to organize, and you need to define your success in terms of those values.

We have a core group of people who nearly always come, and it’s wonderful to see new attendees.\nIf you do have lofty expectations, make them a long term goal and focus on one aspect at a time, such as making your meetup more welcoming, or finding someone else to help host the meetups."

There is a cure for that, and that is finding co-organizers for your meetup.\nThese co-organizers should be people you can trust and depend on, that you want to hang out with. Even if no one else came to a meetup event, you will still get to hang out with them and it won’t feel like wasted effort. You should have shared values.\nIt’s better to identify people and approach them directly rather than putting out a call for organizers. Perhaps there was a member of previous meetups that was especially helpful to others.\nThe key piece of advice that I’ve gotten from many organizers is to: start small with your core group, rather than starting with large events from the get-go. Having a strong core group will naturally grow through word of mouth."

Advanced users are very different than beginner users.\nDo you want your meetup to be accessible?\nDo you want your meetup to be psychologically safe?\n\nIn the end, these values will also help define roles and responsibilities for your meetup, which we’ll discuss more in Part 3."

There are specific needs for your meetup:\n\nMeetup Space\nDedicated online discussion forums (such as Slack/Microsoft Teams/Discord)\nPrep time for talks/activities\n\nSponsors can help with these needs. I’ve heard time and again from internal meetup attendees that they like the meetup, but they’re often too busy with other work to attend regularly. This is often a sign of an organizational culture that prizes busy-ness (not business) over personal development. Sponsors can help with this by opening up work schedules for personal development."

Organizing meetups is important emotional labor, as you are building ties across groups in your organization. Negotiating for protected time when you can do this work is a very good start. Making sure that the meetup is included as criteria for yearly reviews is also important. If you are doing it to benefit your organization, you should be recognized for it.\nMeetups often result in collaboration across groups, and improved morale in an organization. Organizations often brag that they are a learning organization. Hold their feet to the fire so that they support this important venue for learning, collaboration, and development. Some of this may have to do with managing up: understanding the motivations of your supervisors and showing the benefits of the meetup in language that matters to them. At the very least, show alignment of your group with their overall strategy - show how the meetup will contribute to their goals.\nGathering testimonies from meetup attendees is another important type of evidence of impact. Approaching people who are getting a lot out of your meetup and asking for a couple sentences about the benefits they’ve enjoyed from the meetup can be very useful, especially in a final report used in a performance review."

I believe that the test of any good group is whether you can leave it and it can continue on.\nIn the final part, we’ll talk about how to make your meetup welcoming to new attendees. Sustaining a meetup has to do a lot with making it appealing to people who will contribute, and making it easy for those people to contribute.

Invite a couple people to start out with.\nAs word gets out, your group will grow and attract more people. If it doesn’t, a small meetup is good too. Don’t compare your meetup to other meetups.\nA vital criteria to grow your meetup is that it should feel psychologically safe for all. Let’s dive into that next."

    "text": "Welcoming = Values + Code of Conduct\nIn order to be psychologically safe, your meetup should have a code of conduct. You don’t need to write one from scratch; the R-Ladies Code of Conduct is a great place to start. Codes of conduct are extremely important, because they define what is unacceptable behavior at a meetup. That’s the negative side.\nThere has been a lot written about codes of conduct, so I’ll briefly recap and point you to their writing. Both online and in person meetups have had some sort of harassment. The Code of Conduct defines what is unacceptable behavior, such as harassment (either physical or online) and defines the consequences of that unacceptable behavior.\nHere are a couple of Codes of Conduct to get you inspired.\n\nR Ladies Code of Conduct\nOHSU BioData Club Code of Conduct\nPDX R User Group Code of Conduct\n\nIf at all possible, post the Code of Conduct so others can peruse it.\nWe usually begin our meetups by reading the first paragraph of the meetup, signalling what is unacceptable behavior.\nYou need to have a contact to notify in case there are any breaches of the code of conduct. Our approach is to believe those who contact us. Depending on the severity of the breach, you may ban the breacher from a single meetup, or from the meetup altogether."

    "section": "Positively Express Your Values",
    "text": "Positively Express Your Values\nA code of conduct is not enough. You also need to positively model the values you established as a core group in Part 2. Being conscious of these values is incredibly important, as they set the positive tone for the group. Some of the values of PDX-R are:\n\nLearn Together\nBeginner Friendly\nHave Fun with Data\n\nOur values permeate in how we communicate with Meetup members. As an example, when we make an announcement for PDX-R, we always make sure to welcome beginners.\n\n\nThis is tomorrow! (May 18 @ 6:30 PST)If you are wondering what the hubbub is about #quartopub, then come and learn!Beginners especially welcome! #rstats https://t.co/FYZhqThtvR\n\n— PDX R (@pdxrlang) May 17, 2023\n\n\nThese values are also expressed in the activities our group does. Our default activity is aggRegate, where everyone comes in with questions or problems and we try to solve them together. This really helps to empower members (see below section for more info).\nAnother great example comes from the Carpentries Instructor training, which reminds instructors to avoid using the word “just”:\n\n[Don’t] Use the J word (“just”) or other demotivating words we talked about in a previous lesson. These signal to the learner that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that they therefore must be deficient if they are not able to figure it out.\n\nInitially, you may have to gently remind individual members about the values of your meetup. Try to do this one on one.\nBy establishing the tone of your meetup, you will actually define the norms for the group, which is the case for groups like R for Data Science. What once seemed artificial will become the norm for the group. But it helps to tactfully remind people of these values early on (“We don’t say just”, “We want to be welcoming of others”)."

    "text": "Make it easy to contribute\nNow that we’ve defined ways to make it safe for members, let’s talk about some low-risk activities that members can contribute to. Making it easy for members to contribute empowers them and increases group cohesion. It also lessens the burden on organizers.\nI’m going to list some activities here that have worked for us and for other groups in the past. Feel free to use the resources or modify them to work for your group.\n\nCo-working and Co-learning: aggRegate\nThis is our usual monthly activity, where we introduce ourselves and something we’re struggling with. The key with aggRegate is not to be a know-it-all - it’s to learn. The key is that our combined knowledge is greater than our individual knowledge. If I don’t know something, then the odds are that someone else in the group knows it. I’ve learned a lot from these sessions. One of the keys is hold back and let the group answer the questions. That way, it becomes the norm rather than just expecting the answer from one person.\nA related activity is co-working. Co-working is similar, but you don’t have any questions, the goal is just to hang out, do some work, and update each other on what you’re working on.\n\n\nBeginner Office Hours\nIf you want to be especially beginner friendly, you can host a Beginner’s Office Hour where you encourage any and all questions. Some groups have dedicated the first 1/2 hour of their online meetups to these beginning office hours. That way, they can ease into the meetup having met other people in a more relaxed setting.\n\n\nData Scavenger Hunts\nOne fun activity is to explore a dataset together. I’ve built a Shiny data explorer app called {burro} which makes it easy for everyone to explore a dataset together. It’s focused on the descriptives, which at least lets us know some things about the data quality.\nIt can help to have some group goals, such as when we explored a dataset about African Americans and their accomplishments.\nMembers can then team up and try to answer a question or build a visualization, with some time at the end to show their results.\nTidy Tuesday is a great source for these datasets, as is the {fivethirtyeight} package. Do some pre-session exploration in order to ensure that the data is appropriate for the group’s goals.\n\n\nWatching Videos Together\nOne activity that has been successful with very little prep is watching a video together online. When the {gt} package was brand new, our group wanted to learn it, but none of us knew anything about it. So we watched Rich Iannone’s gt talk and did a live chat alongside it. The questions we came up with during our viewing we used for further discussion.\n\n\nA Tidyverse Function I Love\nThe tidyverse is wide and deep. Oftentimes, other people know about a tidyverse function that others don’t. Which is why I started.\n\n\nLightning Talks\n\n\nWorkshops"
