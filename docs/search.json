It is a lot of work, especially when organizing talks and setting up speakers.\nHere are 4 major symptoms of burnout and how they might manifest in you, the meetup organizer.\n\nLack of Motivation and Dread\n\n(“Oh crap! I need to organize next month’s meetup”)\n\nCynicism\n\n(“This isn’t helping anyone”)\n\nDetachment\n\n(“I’m the only one keeping the meetup afloat”)\n\nSense of Failure\n\n(“I’m not doing enough”)\n\n\nOverall, unpacking these feelings is going to take some doing. I think we can address some of these issues and feelings head on. Let’s start with some self-care strategies."

    "text": "1. You are doing enough\nTake a breath and realize what you do is valuable. You are connecting people. You are bridging everyone’s interests in data science. You are helping others learn, while hopefully learning something yourself. Be patient with yourself and don’t set unrealistic expecations.\nWhat I mean by unrealistic expectations is that we expect ourselves to be superhuman in a very limited amount of time. Many of us are doing the organizing on a volunteer basis. We need to scale our expectations of what can be done into that limited amount of time.\nYou’re not going to make everyone happy. You don’t necessarily want the unhappy people in your meetup anyhow."

    "text": "2. A Meetup Can Be Anything\nPart of being patient with ourselves as organizers is resetting our expectations for what a meetup should be. I think a lot of us are stuck in the seminar mindset: every event should be a didactic talk where some expert is teaching us something.\nThese expectations are what drive us to meetup burnout.\nA meetup event doesn’t need to be this. It can just be social. The point is to do something together: watching a video together, doing a workshop together, or troubleshooting problems together. You’ll be surprised by the knowledge in your group. Everyone knows something, and when we come together, we will always be more than the sum of our knowledge.\nIn a later part, I’m going to talk more about meetup activities that work for us, and more importantly, the importance of having meetups where it is easy for your attendees to contribute to."

But if we’re the ones organizing events, then we need to work according to our schedule.\nNot everyone is going to make every meetup, and that’s ok."

You have to find someone to give the talk that is knowledgable, you need to find times that work, and inform them of their audience and set expectations of your topic.\nAgain, I think the expectation is for us to want to be superhuman when we don’t have time for even being human. So, we need to be more gentle with ourselves and find activities and events that don’t eat up our very limited time."

I think many of us think that we want everyone to be happy with the topic, and have our meetup grow with every event.\nYour values matter. They’re what drive you to organize, and you need to define your success in terms of those values. What are the fun parts of your meetup?\nI have redefined my success with meetups by how many repeat attendees we have. We have a core group of people who nearly always come, and it’s wonderful to see new attendees.\nIf you do have lofty expectations, make them a long term goal and focus on one aspect at a time, such as making your meetup more welcoming, or finding someone else to help host the meetups."

But you should not try and be an expert at everything, know when you don’t know something, and know when to ask for help. Don’t take this burden up - the gaps in knowledge will be filled by your community members.\nI try and model this for our meetup group by letting others answer questions, and I freely admit when I don’t know something."
